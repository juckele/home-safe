# home-safe
A wrapper for a persistent TerrariaServer to automatically save when users leave the server

Home-Safe is no where near as advanced as other Terraria servers like TShock, but because it is a thin wrapper around the official server, it is always compatible with the newest version. Home-Safe adds one major feature to the vanilla Terrraria server, it automatically saves every time a player leaves.
